## Documentaion :

this lib is intended for testing only
do not use it for production .
i will make use of the functional programming paradigm this mean :

- reducing side effects (no mutation)
- semi pure functions (pure function are not possible cause of IO and fetching external APIs)
- no Class's (even if they are just a syntactic sugar on top of Constructor Functions and Prototypes)

### Dealing with APIs :

**TODO**
provide functions for doing :

- fetching json data
- useful errors
- an easy interface to make (http request with CRUD Operations HEADERS)
- some of these functions will return (js object , void ...)
